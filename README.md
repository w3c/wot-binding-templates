This repository is for discussion and development of the W3C Web of Things (WoT) Binding Templates document.

Each commit here will sync it to the master, which will expose the content to [http://w3c.github.io/wot-binding-templates/](http://w3c.github.io/wot-binding-templates/.)

Binding Templates document is made of multiple subspecifications that each describe the use of a protocol, media type or platform.
For convenience purposes, the currently available Editor's Draft of subspecifications are linked below:

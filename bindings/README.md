# Binding Description

This folder contains the documentation about different Protocol Bindings. The folder is organized in sub-folders that contains
binding-specific documentation. Each sub-folder typically provide the following:

- index.html based on [index.template.html](/index.template.html)
- shacl file that describes which ontology terms can be used and how
- context.jsonld file containing the related jsonld `@context` definition
- A JSON Schema file based on [template.schema.json](/template.schema.json) that describes the binding structure for validation purposes.

Please refer to the [WoT Binding Registry](https://w3c.github.io/wot-binding-registry/) for the complete list of requirements and the process.

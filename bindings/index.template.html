        <p>
            In the context of the Web of Things (WoT), a Binding is a blueprint that gives guidance on how to 
            implement a specific IoT protocol, data format or IoT platform.
            The Thing Description specification explains the overall mechanism and requirements for any binding to follow.
            This document gives implementation guidelines regarding the X, which is used here and there, has features Y and Z.
            <!-- Please make sure that the part starts by "This document" is not longer than 2 or 3 sentences and it is objective,
            i.e. do not say it is the best protocol to do something -->
        </p>
        <p>
            More specifically, this document defines a set of vocabulary terms that can be used inside a Thing Description or Thing Model document, 
            and associated rules which allow to describe WoT operations using X over the network.
            Additionally, relevant examples are provided to showcase different vocabulary terms and the associated behavior.

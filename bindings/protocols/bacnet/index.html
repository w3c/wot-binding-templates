            In the context of the Web of Things (WoT), a Binding Template is a blueprint that gives guidance on how to
            implement a specific IoT protocol, data format, or IoT platform.
            The Core Binding Templates specification explains the overall mechanism and requirements for any binding to
            follow.
            This document gives implementation guidelines regarding BACnet [[BACnet]], a building automation and control
            networking protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
            More specifically, this document defines a set of vocabulary terms that can be used inside a Thing
            Description document,
            and associated rules that allow to describe WoT operations using BACnet over the network.
            Additionally, relevant examples are provided to showcase different vocabulary terms and the associated
            behavior.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            BACnet [[BACnet]] is a building automation and control networking
            protocol for applications such as heating, ventilating, and air
            conditioning control, lighting control, access control, and fire
            detection systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            This document describes how the Web of Things Thing Description [[WOT-THING-DESCRIPTION]] (TD) can be used
            to represent devices that use BACnet.
            In particular, the document explains how to create valid TD Forms for the
            different operations that BACnet can perform.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="conformance">
        <p>
            Forms of a Thing Description instance with BACnet Binding complies with this specification if it follows
            the normative statements in [[[#vocabulary]]] and [[[#mappings]]].
        </p>
        <p>
            A JSON Schema [[?JSON-SCHEMA]] to validate Thing Description instances
            containing BACnet Binding is provided in the <a href="bacnet.schema.json">GitHub repository</a>.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="scope">
        <h2>Binding Scope</h2>
        <p>
            It is assumed the reader of this document is familiar with the basic
            principles and mechanisms of the BACnet standard [[BACnet]].
        </p>
        <p>
            The following subset of BACnet features is supported by this binding:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Services: ReadProperty, WriteProperty, SubscribeCOV
            </li>
            <li>
                Data Model: Device, Object, Property, Index
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            This protocol binding is intended to be used to enable web applications
            to interact with data and control affordances exposed by BACnet devices.
            It is not intended that this binding be used for device commissioning,
            onboarding, or device management.
        </p>
        <p>
            WoT Interaction Affordances are mapped to BACnet Properties. If the BACnet
            property-identifier is not present in the URI element of the form, the
            object-identifier is used to interact with the BACnet Object, exposing
            the present-value Property.
        </p>
        <p>
            When it is necessary to expose properties other than the present-value
            property, the property-identifier must be included in the URI element of
            the form.
        </p>
        <p>
            Selected BACnet Service parameters are exposed as URI Variables to enable
            WoT consumers access to BACnet features, for example, Command Priority.

        <h2>URI Scheme</h2>
        <p>
            In cases where a URI is needed to refer to data that is accessible
            using BACnet services, the 'bacnet' URI scheme provides a means to
            identify a property of an object in the scope of a BACnet device.
            The 'bacnet' URI scheme does not provide means to identify the
            BACnet network on which a device resides, or the network access
            method, physical media, or protocol service to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 'bacnet' URI Scheme used herein is based on the definition in Annex Q.8 of
            the BACnet Specification [[BACnet]].

            The additions to Q.8 are as follows:

        <ol>
            <li>object-type and property-identifier are restricted to their numeric versions and not the registered
                alphanumeric identifiers, in order to reduce the maintenance overhead when new object-types and
                property-identifiers are introduced in the BACnet standard.</li>
            <li>Query components (as per <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.4">RFC 3986 Section
                    3.4</a>) are added to cover specific needs not covered in Annex Q.8. Current examples are command
                priority and COV increment.</li>
        </ol>

                The syntax for the 'bacnet' URI scheme is specified below in
                Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [[RFC5234]]:
            </p>

                    The <code>device</code> component specifies the device
                    instance number in decimal. A <code>device</code> identifier
                    of <code>.this</code> means "this device" so that it can be
                    used in static files that do not need to be changed when the
                    device identifier changes.

                    sub-components: the object-type and the object-instance
                    number. The object-type is either a decimal number in the
                    range 0 to 2<sup>10</sup>-1 (inclusive) or exactly equal to
                    the identifier text of one of the named items of the
                    BACnetObjectType enumeration defined in Clause 21 of
                    [[BACnet]]. The object-instance number is a decimal number
                    in the range 0 to 2<sup>22</sup>-1 (inclusive).

                    number or exactly equal to the identifier text of one of the
                    named items of the BACnetPropertyIdentifier enumeration
                    defined in Clause 21 of [[BACnet]]. If it is omitted, it
                    defaults to <code>present-value</code> except for BACnet
                    File objects, where the absence of the <code>property</code>
                    component refers to the entire content of the file accessed

            <p>
                URI Variables are included in the 'bacnet' URI Scheme and are included in the Protocol Binding to
                communicate PDU option settings for the BACnet driver to use when sending requests.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following JSON example shows the usage of the BACnet vocabulary for URI Variables, specifically
                CommandPriority and CovIncrement. The semantic annotation is optional.
            </p>
            <p>
                This template could be used to construct the uriVariables element for TD interaction affordances, to
                enable the application to communicate URI variables to the BACnet driver, using a consistent format
                according to the schema constraints below.
            </p>
            <p>
                These variables may be also fixed in the href and not exposed via URI variables, causing the BACnet
                driver to use a constant value for this parameter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some aspects were identified as improvement candidates in TD.next, which may result in breaking changes
                regarding URI variables:
            <ol>
                <li>Showing the link of URI variables to exactly which operations they apply to.</li>
                <li>Exposing protocol-related parameters from Form-level instead of InteractionAffordance-level.</li>
                <li>Providing a standardized set of parameters.</li>
                <li>Having the ability to use parameters also in other places than the href</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>WoT Data Schema and BACnet Types</h3>
            <p>
                BACnet has its own data model, which cannot always be derived
                from the data schema of the interaction affordances. Hence
                the type information is amended in the Form (column 3) of the protocol binding while
                staying conceptually conformant to the WoT Data Schema (column 2).
                The goal here is to abstract BACnet's data model into a Web-like JSON-based
                data model, by still keeping the wire compatibility on the protocol.
                The table below shows how the mappings are done, comprehensively for all BACnet types.

            <h3>Mappings related to events</h3>
            <p>
                BACnet has an extensive alarm model; see [[BACnet]] Chapter 13. Alarm and Event Services for a complete description.

                The fundamental aspects are as follows:

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        There are three event states: Normal (no event); OffNormal (e.g., operating temperature outside of the normal range);
                        and Fault (e.g., defective sensor). Events are sent for transitions, including self-transitions and toNormal transitions.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Objects can monitor themselves for event states (intrinsic reporting),
                        or dedicated other objects can monitor other objects (algorithmic reporting)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alarms are always sent via Notification Class objects, which keep lists of alarm recipients, i.e., alarm subscriptions
                        are always of the Notification Classes; it is not possible to receive alarms only from some of the objects linked
                        to a given Notification Class. In the typical case, a client will register to all Notification Classes of a BACnet Device.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some alarms can be configured as "acknowledgement required". Acknowledgement is defined by BACnet as a manual action
                        performed by a human operator, and is separate from the confirmation of the successful reception of the event notification.

                    </li>
                </ol>
                The picture below demonstrates these key aspects and how they are mapped to the WoT concepts.
            </p>
            <img src="../../../images/bacnet_events.drawio.svg" alt="BACnet Eventing Overview and its mapping to WoT" />
            <p>
                The key aspects of the mapping to WoT are:
                <ol>
                    <li>Each Notification Class is mapped to an EventAffordance. This maps directly to the subscription granularity.</li>
                    <li>Event Enrollment objects used for algorithmic reporting are not explicitly mapped; they are not relevant to the WoT consumer, per se.</li>
                    <li>
                        Special event-related actions (getting current events and acknowledging events) are mapped to ActionAffordances.
                        <div class="note">
                            <p>The WoT consumer does not need to know the details of BACnet alarming; it can simply interact with the InteractionAffordances of the Thing,
                            according to their data schemata. However, the consumer does need to have an understanding of the relations
                            between the InteractionAffordances:</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <code>GetCurrentEvents</code> action can be used to fetch all current events of the thing, which would not be received
                                    just by subscribing to events. This action delivers the same payload as the EventAffordance's data.

                                    <code>AcknowledgeEvent</code> action can be used for all events (including the ones received via <code>GetCurrentEvents</code>),
                                    where the <code>ackReq</code> field is true. Here the <code>source</code> field of the event should match the <code>eventSource</code>
                                    field of <code>AcknowledgeEvent.input</code>.

                        Thing is assumed to be mapped to the BACnet device. While this is simple, it is not a mandatory decision.
                        In specific cases, one BACnet device can correspond to multiple things, and even vice-versa.

                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast to PropertyAffordances, which are generically mapped to BACnet,
                interactions related to events come with a specific payload specified by the BACnet standard. The flexibility that would be possible, for example,
                for an HTTP longpoll-based event notification with a custom HTTP body, is not possible in BACnet context.
                Thus, it is necessary for the WoT consumer to work with a given logical data schema that is influenced by the BACnet standard.
                Still, this binding takes an approach to define the data schemata of the InteractionAffordances as independently as possible from BACnet, in
                order to avoid a direct dependency of WoT consumers on a specific protocol.
            </p>
            <p>
                With this background, this binding takes some simplifying design decisions:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        When the BACnet payload is fixed by the BACnet standard for a given service — e.g., event subscription, or
                        data or alarm acknowledgement — the binding doesn't model the BACnet data with <code>bacv:hasDataType</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some features of the BACnet alarm model are abstracted away: filtering alarms based on day of week, time of day, and event state;
                        and using unconfirmed event notifications. If these become necessary, they can be added in a future version.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Payloads containing three event states (Normal, OffNormal, Fault) are split into simpler payloads for each event state. For instance,
                        GetEventInformation sends one array item for each BACnet object containing three flags, three timestamps, three acknowledge flags, etc.,
                        for each possible event state. This binding splits that payload in the ActionAffordance's output into multiple payloads for each
                        active event, with one timestamp, acknowledge flag, etc. This approach makes the output similar to the EventAffordance data
                        payload and removes the three-event state-based BACnet design from the WoT Consumer's view.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                The resulting data payloads look like this:

                            This is to be processed and split into one standalone event for every current event, or past unacknowledged event, of this object, with corresponding timestamp, priority, etc.

            affordance-level can be
            used and how they need to be represented in a <code>forms</code> element.
            The <code>"bacv:covIncrement"</code> indicates that the URI variable set by the Consumer application will be
            used to notify the
            Consumer only if the property value changes more than the set amount by the URI variable.

            [[[#example-uri-variable-for-writing]]] demonstrates how the <code>uriVariable</code> in the
            affordance-level can be used to model a writing priority in a <code>forms</code> element.
            The <code>"bacv:commandPriority"</code> indicates that the URI variable set by the Consumer application will
            be relayed as the priority argument in the WriteProperty request.
            For other operations (readproperty, observeproperty, unobserveproperty) this URI variable is irrelevant, so the corresponding forms do not use the URI variable.
            If the URI variable is also irrelevant for the writeproperty operation (e.g., when the BACnet object doesn't have a priority array),
            it can also be left out of the writeproperty form and the URI variable can be omitted completely.
            The URI variable comes with a default, so if the Consumer doesn't provide this URI variable, the default of 16 will be used.
            Another possibility is to fix the writing priority in the TD by giving a fixed commandPriority in the <code>href</code> of the form, and not exposing its value via a URI variable.
            These decisions belong to the TD author.

        <p>
            [[[#example-event-data]]] shows an event notification because of an overheating piece of equipment. Event <code>message</code>
            gives this as a useful hint; <code>prio</code> is set accordingly. <code>values</code> object gives additional details
            about the event — that the current value is 55, and the exceeded limit was 50. The unit of these values can be found at the
            <code>source</code> object that triggered this event.
            Because overheating events are important for the operator to notice, <code>ackReq</code> is set, so the operator definitely
            will see the event, even after the overheating condition is over.

        </pre>

        <p>
            When the operator sees this event and decides to acnowledge it, management station will send the payload shown in
            [[[#example-acknowledgeevent-input]]]. This can happen before or after the event is over.

        </pre>

        <p>
            If the event client wants to get a list of all events of the device, it will invoke the GetCurrentEvents action, and will receive
            te payload shown in [[[#example-getcurrentevents-output]]]. Here the event notification about the overheating and a past fault event can be
            seen. This is useful for synchronizing the events known on the client to the events that are on the device, in case of temporary
            disconnection, reboot of client or device, etc. Please note that in the second alarm, the <code>ackReq</code> value turned to 0,
            because this event was acknowledged by the operator in the meantime.

        <p>
            In the context of the Web of Things (WoT), a Binding Template is a blueprint that gives guidance on how to 
            implement a specific IoT protocol, data format or IoT platform.
            The Core Binding Templates specification explains the overall mechanism and requirements for any binding to follow.
            This document gives implementation guidelines regarding the Modbus protocol, which is a well-known 
            cost-effective IoT protocol for communication between industrial control and automation devices. 
        </p>
        <p>
            More specifically, this document defines a set of vocabulary terms that can be used inside a Thing Description document, 
            and associated rules which allow to describe WoT operations using the Modbus protocol over the network.
            Additionally, relevant examples are provided to showcase different vocabulary terms and the associated behavior.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The Modbus is a data communication protocol originally developed by Modicon which is now a part of Schneider Electric.
            The protocol was specifically designed for the remote management of the hardware devices in the industrial environment.
            For this reason, it has low level of abstraction and it has built in bit handling capabilities oriented to the direct
            control of the relays and generic contact statuses.
            The physical layer it is mainly an RS485 differential bus which has less susceptibility to the EMC interference. This Limit
            the usability of the protocol in short distance networks, typically within a kilometer. 
            Due to its age the protocol does not implement any safety system, so usually when wide internet access is needed it is
            encapsulated in a TCP/IP protocol and with Ethernet as a physical layer. Thanks to this encapsulation strategy, the Modbus protocol
            can reach remote nodes deployed in distant facilities over the internet. Moreover, in the years due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness 
            the Modbus protocol becomes a standard all over the world. This fame together with the advancement of the microcontroller/microprocessor led to 
            a shift on how applications pack the information. Today it is usual to store and read any type of data in the Holdings Registers like bit,bytes,words, float etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            This document describes how the Web of Things specification can be use to present devices that use the Modbus protocol in a <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-architecture/#sec-thing-description">Thing Description</a>. In 
            particular, the document explain how to create valid URLs and Forms for the different operations that the Modbus protocol can perform. Developers are 
            encouraged to use this document as an implementation guidelines and as a reference for the creation of their own binding implementations. The following sections
            will cover the URL format, the Vocabulary and a list of Form examples.

        <h2>URL format</h2>
        Historically different URL scheme has been used inside the Modbus community: <code>modbus+tpc://</code>, <code>modbus+ascii://</code> and <code>modbus+rtu://</code>.
        Considering that in Web of Things context all protocol bindings are required to at least support the Internet Protocol, for the Modbus protocol <code>modbus+tcp://</code> 
        was selected as the only valid URL scheme. The following shows the typical structure of an URL of the Modbus protocol:
        <pre>
            modbus+tcp://{address}:{port}/{?unitID}
        </pre>

        <p>
            Where:
            <ul>
                <li><code>{address}</code> is the IP address of the Modbus device</li>
                <li><code>{port}</code> is the port of the Modbus device</li>
                <li><code>{unitID}</code> is the unit ID of the Modbus device. See <a href="#vocabulary">vocabulary</a></li>

        <h2>Modbus Vocabulary</h2>
        This section describes the vocabulary used in the Modbus protocol. A protocol binding implementation should use the vocabulary defined in this section to
        describe the different configuration that can be used to exchanged data between Web of Things.

        This section will present a set of examples about how the terms defined in this document can be used
        to describe and configure a <a>Form</a>. The [[[#example-read-coil]]] shows the minimal set of terms 
        to configure a single coil reading using Modbus. Notice that the unitID is contained in the href as the 
        first element of the path. 
        <pre id="example-read-coil" class="example" title="Read a single coil">

                "modbus:address": 1
            }
        </pre>
        To describe forms with multiple operations types, the [[[#entity]]] keyword can be used to create 
        a short description of the modbus endpoint.
        <pre id="example-read-coil-entity" class="example" title="Read and write single coil">
                    {

        A TD processor will intepred [[[#example-read-coil-entity]]] configuration as the following:

        Reducing effectively the verbosity of a TD. 

        Thanks to the expressiveness of the Modbus ontology users can describe also the total 
        number of registries read or wrote in a WoT operation. [[[#example-read-holding]]] shows how to read or write 
        8 HoldingRegisters.

        When possible WoT consumers will use Modbus features to read the desired amount of data with a single
        protocol request. However, it may be possible to still specify a total length for Modbus operations
        that do not support reading or writing on a range of registers (see [[[#example-read-coil-range]]]). 
        In these circumstances consumers will perform different requests to satisfy the configuration requirements. 
        <pre id="example-read-coil-range" class="example" title="Read and write 8 single coils with one form">
                            {
                                "href": "modbus+tcp://127.0.0.1:60000/1",
                                "op": [
                                    "readproperty",
                                    "writeproperty"
                                ],
                                "modbus:entity": "Coil",
                                "modbus:address": 1,
                                "modbus:quantity": 8
                            }
                </pre>
        Another notable configuration of a form using the Modbus vocabulary is the polling mechanism. Thanks
        to the keyword <code>pollingTime</code> the user can indicate the intervals for observing a particular
        set of registers. Supposing that the device knows that the value of coil register 1 does change every 
        1000 ms, in [[[#example-polling]]], it suggest that the polling time should not be faster than 10 ms. WoT 
        consumers may still create requests faster than the specified time but it should be taken as a reasonable
        default for observing a property. 
        <pre  id="example-polling" class="example" title="Polling">
            {
                "href": "modbus+tcp://127.0.0.1:60000/1",
                "op": [
                    "observeproperty"
                ],
                "modbus:entity": "Coil",
                "modbus:pollingTime": 1000,
                "modbus:address": 1

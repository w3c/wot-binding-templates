        <p>
            In the context of the Web of Things (WoT), a Binding Template is a blueprint that gives guidance on how to 
            implement a specific IoT protocol, data format or IoT platform.
            The Core Binding Templates specification explains the overall mechanism and requirements for any binding to follow.
            This document gives implementation guidelines regarding the MQTT protocol, which is
            a lightweight, asynchronous, transport-independent, open protocol for publishing and subscribing to messages. 
            It has been employed in many IoT platforms and IoT applications for its simplicity and scalability.
        </p>
        <p>
            More specifically, this document defines a set of vocabulary terms that can be used inside a Thing Description document, 
            and associated rules which allow to describe WoT operations using the MQTT protocol over the network.
            Additionally, relevant examples are provided to showcase different vocabulary terms and the associated behavior.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol [[MQTT]] was born in 1999 to handle
            efficient machine to machine communication in the Internet of Things. The protocol
            is based on the publish subscribe model, where publishers publish messages to 
            specific topics and subscribers receive notifications for filters that match one
            or more topics. The protocol is well-known for its simplicity and scalability and
            is used in many IoT platforms and applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the context of the Internet of Things, many vendors expose MQTT publishers mixed with 
            Web protocols like HTTP. This document explain how to describe MQTT endpoints and payloads with 
            Thing Descriptions (TDs) the core building block of the Web of Things (WoT) [[WOT-ARCHITECTURE]].
        </p>
        <p>
            This version of the document is designed around each affordance having its own MQTT topic.
            Usage of MQTT with an additional protocol on top that uses topics with specific payloads is possible, but it
            implies defining a payload structure in each affordance.
            Thus, this way of using MQTT is not supported out-of-the-box in this document.
        </p>

    <section id="conformance">
        <p>
            Forms of a Thing Description instance with MQTT Binding complies with this specification if it follows 
            the normative statements in <a href="#possible-mappings"></a> and <a href="#default-mappings"></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            A JSON Schema [[?JSON-SCHEMA]] to validate Thing Description instances

            Notice that the URL does not contain any information regarding [[[#topicname]]] or [[[#topicfilter]]]. 
            These two parameters must be specified using their own parameter as described in [[[#form-terms]]]. 
            This is necessary to avoid ambiguities regarding the starting <code>/</code> character and the usage of <code>#</code> which can be confused with the URL
            fragment character.

      <p>
        In MQTT protocol messages are called Control Packets. An MQTT Control Packet consists of up to three parts: fixed header (present in all Control Packets), variable header, payload. 
          The fixed header consists of a packet type and flags. The main packet types that can be uses in a Form are listed below. 
          Although, it is possible to use different values of [[[#controlpacket]]] in forms, it is recommended to use the mapping defined in [[[#default-mappings]]].

        The Quality of Service (QoS) is a mechanism to ensure that messages are delivered to the subscriber in the order in which they were published.
        In the Web of Things the QoS reported in the TD when paired with <code>writeproperty</code> or <code>invokeaction</code> operation is used to determine the
        minimum QoS that the consumer must use to publish the message. On the other hand, when paired with <code>subscribeevent</code>, <code>observeproperty</code>,
        or <code>readproperty</code>, it indicates to the WebThing must send messages with that minimum QoS.
        The QoS values are defined in the MQTT specification. The QoS values are:

      For the MQTT protocol, if an MQTT client publishes a message to a topic with the retain flag set to true, the future subscribers of the topic will also get this message.
      Outside of this case, it is not possible to read a property but only possible to observe it. 
      <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="iana-security-alter">Additionally, in a Form element with MQTT protocol,

      <span class="rfc2119-assertion" id="iana-security-alter">On the other hand, if the MQTT publisher does not set

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        The following examples show how to use the MQTT protocol in a Thing Description. The [[[#example-simple-event]]] 
        shows a simple form that indicates to compliant Consumers to subscribe or unsubscribe to the topic <code>thing1/events/overheating</code> in order to execute the <code>subscribevent</code> or <code>unsubscribevent</code> operation, respectively.
      </p>
      <pre id="example-simple-event" class="example" title="Simple event form">
        {
            "href": "mqtt://broker.com:1883",
            "op": [
                "subscribeevent",
                "unsubscribeevent"
            ],
            "mqv:filter": "thing1/events/overheating" 
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        [[[#example-simple-publish]]] shows how to use the <code>mqv:publish</code> packet when invoking a 
        command. Remember that the <code>invokeaction</code> operation is mapped to <code>mqv:publish</code>
        control packet in [[[#default-mappings]]]. 
      </p>
      <pre id="example-simple-publish" class="example" title="Publish form">
        {
            "href": "mqtt://broker.com:1883",
            "op": [

            ], 
            "mqv:topic": "application/devices/thing1/program/commands/reset"
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        Continuing with increasingly more complex examples, [[[#example-property]]] shows how to use the MQTT protocol when handling properties.
        <code>mqv:retain</code> is used to indicate the ability to read the property rather than just observe it. 
      </p>
      <pre id="example-property" class="example" title="How to describe a complex property">
        [{
            "href": "mqtt://broker.com:1883",
            "op": [
                "writeproperty"
            ], 
            "mqv:retain" : true,
            "mqv:topic": "application/devices/thing1/properties/test"
        },
        {

            "op": [
                "readproperty",
                "observeproperty"
            ],
            "mqv:retain" : true,
            "mqv:filter": "application/devices/thing1/properties/test"
            }
        ]
      </pre>
      <p>
        If the implementer wants to give the ability to WoT clients to conveniently observe all properties in a single call, it is possible
        to use <code>observeallproperties</code> form in the root of a Thing Description. 
        For example, in [[[#example-property-observeall]]] all the messages to topics 
        under <code>application/devices/thing1/properties/</code> will be delivered.
      </p>
      <pre id="example-property-observeall" class="example" title="Root observe all form">
              {
                  "href": "mqtt://broker.com:1883",
                  "op": [
                      "observeallproperties"
                  ], 
                  "mqv:filter": "application/devices/thing1/properties/#"
              }
      </pre>
      <p>
        When the Web Thing wants to force a minimum level of [[[#qualityofservice]]] for a property, it can use the
        <code>mqv:qos</code> property in the Form element as shown in [[[#example-qos]]]. This will guarantee that consumers
        and exposers will get the message at the specified quality of service.
      </p>
      <pre id="example-qos" class="example" title="Use qos parameter">
              [{
                  "href": "mqtt://broker.com:1883",

                      "writeproperty"

                  "op": [
                      "readproperty",

                  "mqv:qos": "1",

              }]
     </pre>

        Finally, [[[#example-full]]] reports a full Thing Description for a fictional commercial device. The broker address is only for
        demonstration purposes.

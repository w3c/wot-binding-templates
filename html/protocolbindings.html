    <h2>From the WoT WG Charter Sec. 2.3</h2>
    <p>While the Thing Description will provide general mechanisms to describe arbitrary protocols, to enable interoperability, the Working Group will define standard binding templates for common protocols.</p> 
    
    These standard binding templates will be created in close collaboration with the industry alliances and standards development organizations responsible for these. This includes definition of mappings from the interactions at the Thing Layer to:</p>
	<bl>
	<li>Transfer layer communication patterns such as push, pull, pub-sub, bi-directional messaging, etc.</li>
	<li>Specific protocols at the transfer layer, e.g., REST-based protocols such as HTTP and CoAP, pub-sub protocols such as MQTT, and raw channel-based protocols such as WebSockets</li>
	</bl>
	<p>The Web of Things has a multi-protocol architecture and bindings to both IP and non-IP transports (e.g., Bluetooth Low Energy) may be defined.</p>

	<p>Support for secure communications will be included, as defined by the Security and Privacy deliverable.</p>

	<p>The Binding Templates deliverable is informative by nature since the intended capabilities of the Thing Description could be used to describe any protocol, even common ones, from first principles. However, interoperability will be enhanced by providing and encouraging the use of standard binding templates for common protocols when possible.</p>

      <section>
      <h2>Assumptions and Design Principles</h2>

      <section>
      <h3>Thing Description</h3>
      <p>
<a href="#fig-td-example"></a> below is an example Thing Description, illustrating two parts. The upper part contains is a description of an interaction, and the lower part is an associated link, which contains the protocol binding.
      </p>
      </section>
      
	  <figure id="fig-td-example">
		<img src="images/td-example.png" style="width:95%"  />
    <figcaption>Example of a Thing Description</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <section>
      <h3>TD Interaction Description</h3>
      <p>
The interaction description part of a Thing Description describes an event, action, or property interaction which is exposed by a thing. Each interaction description contains semantic annotation that describes the type of interaction and its application class, and one or more link elements containing URIs that point to the API entry points for the interaction.
      </p>
      </section>
      
	  <figure id="fig-interaction">
		<img src="images/interaction-description.png" style="width:65%"  />
    <figcaption>Interaction Description Part</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <section>
      <h3>Protocol Binding</h3>
      <p> 
Protocol bindings map abstract WoT interactions to concrete protocol operations. The "link" block provides one or more links that point to entry points used to initiate the protocol operations. 
      </p>
      </section>
      
	  <figure id="fig-protocol-binding">
		<img src="images/protocol-binding-template.png" style="width:75%"  />
    <figcaption>Protocol Binding Part</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <section>
      <h3>Protocol Adaptation</h3>
      <p>
Device protocols from various standards organizations have peculiar patterns for exposing the device features that the protocol uses to encapsulate and communicate information. 
      </p>
      <p>
For example, OCF Resource Types expose a REST API that uses IETF concepts of Resource Type (rt) and Interface Type (if). By contrast, LWM2M/IPSO Smart Objects expose an hierarchy of object ID (collections) and resource ID (items) where the ID numbers provide the semantic identification. 
      </p>
      <p>
These may all use a common communication protocol like CoAP, and representation format like CBOR or JSON, but then require special options like resource type, interface type, content-formats, data types, and payload schemas. 
      </p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
      <h3>Discovery</h3>
      <p>
Discovery of things and features of things that map to TD interactions is outside the scope of protocol bindings as currently defined; in this specification we only cover the event, action, property part of the interaction model. 
      </p>
      <p>
It is assumed that discovery of things on the connected device ecosystem results in a set of discoverable Thing Description instances, corresponding to the discovered things, and will then use the TD discovery mechanisms already defined in the W3C WoT WG/IG.
      </p>
      <p>
For example, there could be a discovery process for each device ecosystem that finds new devices, creates TD instances, and publishes them to a TD directory.
      </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h3>TD Structure</h3>
      <p> 
Except for the link element, the interaction description has the same structure for all instances of a particular thing, regardless of the protocol binding being used. The  protocol binding template is implemented as an extension to the "link" element of the interaction pattern description. 
      </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h3>Input and output data</h3>
      <p> 
Input and Output Data are described in the interaction description and applied to the protocol binding using the information in the "link" element as a binding template. 
      </p>
      <p>
Any data constraints imposed by the underlying ecosystem, such has range, units, resolution/granularity must be exposed by the interaction description in the inputData and outputData elements of the Inteaction Description. The implementation may provide a means to translate and convert units and scales between the WoT Scripting API and the underlying device traits.
      </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h3>Isolation</h3>
      <p> 
The interaction description part and protocol template ("link") part are meant to be isolated from each other and are coupled only through the inputData and outputData elements. There must be therefore consistent labeling of data elements between the interaction description and the binding template.
      </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h3>General purpose protocol driver</h3>
      <p> 
There needs to be enough information in the binidng template to enable a generic protocol driver to construct requests using input data elements and parse output data elements from responses. 
      </p>
      <p>
For example, binding templates for RESTful protocols will look like submission forms, describing the method and options to use to construct the request, as well as a structural description or template to be used to construct and parse data payloads.
      </p>
      </section>
      
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Design Specification</h2>
      <section>
      <h3>Extension of the Interaction Description</h3>
      <p>
The interaction description contains the interaction type, additional semantic annotation for the interaction, and the input data and output data descriptors. 
      </p>
      
	  <figure id="fig-interaction-spec">
		<img src="images/interaction-description.png" style="width:65%"  />
        <figcaption>Interaction Description</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
       
      <p>
The inputData and outputData elements need to be able to accept multiple data items to support complex interactions. For example, an action may accept target value and transition time parameters to invoke. The implementation must pass data values between events, actions, and properties exposed to the scripting API, and the lower level traits exposed by the underlying thing protocols. This is done by labeling the data items with key names using json-schema "property" constructs. 
      </p>
      <p>
The inputData and outputData elements may be annotated with additional value constraints that are inherited from the low level thing traits. These value constraints may be expressed in json-schema validation constructs such as minimum and maximum, minLength, maxLength, etc.. Additional constraints may be specified using appropriate json-schema validation keywords and extended keywords.
      </p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
      <h3>Extension of the "link" element</h3>
      <p>
The "link" element of an interaction description points to and describes how the ecosystem specific driver is to interact with the low level thing API to carry out the interaction, e.g. set property, invoke action.
      </p>
      
      <figure id="fig-protocol-binding-spec">
		<img src="images/protocol-binding-template.png" style="width:75%"  />
        <figcaption>Protocol Binding Part</figcaption>
      </figure>
      

      <p>
For things that expose the device features in a REST and REST-like API, the Protocol Binding is constructed somewhat like an HTML submission form. Metadata in the binding template describes which REST method to use, and any other options that are required to be transmitted in the request or parsed from the response.
      </p>
      <p>
The example OCF protocol binding contains values for Resource Type (rt) and Interface Type (if) required to interact with the appropriate device features.

            W3C Web of Things enables applications to interact with and orchestrate connected Things at the Web scale.
            The standardized abstract interaction model exposed by the WoT Thing Description enables applications to
            scale and evolve independently of the individual Things.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many network-level protocols, standards and platforms for connected Things have already been developed, and
            have millions of devices deployed in the field today. These standards are converging on a common set of
            transport
            protocols and transfer layers, but each has peculiar content formats, payload schemas, and data types.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite using unique formats and data models, the high-level interactions exposed by most connected things
            can be modeled using the Property, Action, and Event interaction affordances of the WoT Thing Description.
        </p>
        <p>
            Binding Templates (now called just Bindings) enable a Thing Description
            to be adapted to a specific protocol, data payload format, and/or
            platform that combines both in specific ways.
            This is done through additional descriptive vocabularies, Thing Models and examples that aim to guide the
            implementors of Things and Consumers alike.

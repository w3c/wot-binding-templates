# How to Edit the Draft for Publication

In each sub directory, you can find the relevant files for the publication process.
In general, you should always consult the W3C Guide page at <https://www.w3.org/Guide>.

## Files

* Overview.html - static HTML for publication
* diff.html - diff between the [previous published verion](https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/NOTE-wot-binding-templates-20200130/) and Overview.html
* index.html - same as the index.html at <https://w3c.github.io/wot-binding-templates/> ([or at the root of the repository](../index.html)) as of 24 May 2023, except for changing the respec option from ED to NOTE.
* static.html - static HTML generated by ReSpec from the index.html above

## How to Generate Each File

Overview.html is generated as follows:

1. Copy index.html from [the root of the repository](../index.html).
2. Change `specStatus` to `"NOTE"` from `"ED"`.
3. Generate static.html by ReSpec from <https://w3c.github.io/wot-binding-templates/> (click "ReSpec" top right and choose "Export" then export as "HTML"). Make sure that you disable browser extensions or open in private window.
4. Output Overview.html as a result of [HTML Tidy](https://www.html-tidy.org/). Use the following command (`tidy -ashtml -i static.html > Overview.html`). The `-ashtml` option is needed until [this issue](https://github.com/htacg/tidy-html5/issues/660) is resolved at HTML Tidy.

## How to Add your Edits based on the Pubrules Errors and Warnings

After checking Overview.html using the [Pubrules checker](https://www.w3.org/pubrules/), we have to edit index.html and then
regenerate the static HTML based on the procedure above to make it easier to generate a Pull Request to update the original
at <https://w3c.github.io/wot-binding-templates> later.

1. Edit index.html,
2. Generate static.html by ReSpec from the index.html (click "ReSpec" top right and choose "Export" then export as "HTML",
3. copy static.html to Overview.html and tidy it up,
4. If there are any remaining errors/warnings with the Pubrules checker results, repeat the edit by going back to #1.

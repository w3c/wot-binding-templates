# How to Edit the Draft for Publication

In each sub directory, you can find the relevant files for the publication process.

## Files

* Overview.html - static HTML for publication
* diff.html - diff between the [previous published verion](https://www.w3.org/wot-binding-templates/) and Overview.html 
<!-- Update the above URL to a static one -->
* index.html - same as the index.html at <https://w3c.github.io/wot-binding-templates/> ([or at the root of the repository](../index.html)) as of 24 May 2023
* static.html - static HTML generated by ReSpec from the index.html above

## How to Generate Each File

Overview.html is generated as follows:

1. As the basis of the check and edit, index.html was copied from [the root of the repository](../index.html).
2. static.html was generated by ReSpec from <https://w3c.github.io/wot-binding-templates/> (click "ReSpec" top right and choose "Export" then export as "HTML").
3. Overview.html copied from static.html above, and then got tidied up using [HTML Tidy](https://www.html-tidy.org/).

## How to add your Edits based on the Pubrules errors/warnings

After checking Overview.html using the [Pubrules checker](https://www.w3.org/pubrules/), we have to edit index.html and then
regenerate the static HTML based on the procedure above to make it easier to generate a Pull Request to update the original
at <https://w3c.github.io/wot-binding-templates> later.

1. Edit index.html,
2. Generate static.html by ReSpec from the index.html (click "ReSpec" top right and choose "Export" then export as "HTML",
3. copy static.html to Overview.html and tidy it up,
4. If there are any remaining errors/warnings with the Pubrules checker results, repeat the edit by going back to #1.

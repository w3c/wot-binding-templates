THIS IS ONLY A PROPOSAL

# Web of Things (WoT) Binding Templates Survey

The Binding Templates Task Force of the W3C Web of Things (WoT) wants to reach out to the WoT developers to get their feedback on the Binding Templates.

This initiative has been started in the [GitHub Issue 221](https://github.com/w3c/wot-binding-templates/issues/221) of the WoT Binding Templates repository. For any feedback on the survey itself, you can comment there.

## Logistics

This section should be removed in the final survey sent to people.

- Tools for Collecting Answers: W3C Questionnaire, Google or Microsoft Forms, GitHub PRs or simply any tool that we seem fit. A single tool should be selected to make it easy to collect the results.
- Date for Sending the Survey: Once the "good enough to send state" is reached for the core document. TODO: Agree on a deadline
- Who to send to:
  - Industry Stakeholders (Liaison SDOs)
  - More discussion is needed in WG to complete this
